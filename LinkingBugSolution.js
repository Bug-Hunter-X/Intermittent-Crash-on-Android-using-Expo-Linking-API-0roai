While the root cause of the crash remains unclear, a partial workaround involves adding a small delay before executing any operations after the URL is opened. This delay appears to improve stability and reduce the occurrences of the crash.  Here's an example:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

const handlePress = async () => {
  const url = 'https://www.example.com'; // Replace with your URL
  const supported = await Linking.canOpenURL(url);

  if (supported) {
    await Linking.openURL(url);
    // Add a small delay (e.g., 500ms) before executing post-linking operations
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
    console.log('URL opened successfully!');
  } else {
    console.log('Don't know how to open URI: ' + url);
  }
};
```

This approach is not a definitive fix.  A more permanent solution requires identifying the underlying issue within the Expo Linking API or Android's interaction with it.
